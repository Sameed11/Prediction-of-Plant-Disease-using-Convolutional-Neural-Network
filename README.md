# Prediction-of-Plant-Disease-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

## 📌 CNN-Based Image Classification of Plant Diseases
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant leaf diseases from images. The model is trained using image augmentation techniques and optimized with BatchNormalization, Dropout, and Adam optimizer. Evaluation includes Confusion Matrix, F1 Score, and Classification Report.

##🔹 Key Features:
✔️ Image Data Preprocessing – Resizing, Normalization, Augmentation
✔️ CNN Model – Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, BatchNormalization, Dropout
✔️ Performance Metrics – Accuracy, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix
✔️ Deep Learning Framework – TensorFlow/Keras
✔️ Dataset – Categorized plant disease images

## 🔹 Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
